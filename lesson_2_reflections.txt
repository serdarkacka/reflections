What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize a repository a folder named .git is created on the current working directory. I need it to track the changes on the working directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Working area is where all changes are done. Staging area allows to follow the "one commit per logical change" rule. It is the area where is used to commit changes to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can add all changed files related to the logical change to the staging area and then make the commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

When I try a new feature and make a branch for this experiment, I can make a dozen commits on this branch. And at some point if I decide not use this experimental feature I can change to master branch and by this way I dont populate my history with unnecessary and unrelated commits.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

With diagrams I can see version graph of my project. I can get information about the current state of the project, such as is there any new feature which is being developed and how this feature is related to the main branch of the project etc.
