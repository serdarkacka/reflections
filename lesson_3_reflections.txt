When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to share my project publicly in order to develop using open source approach. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In this way I can decide to evolve my project in logical manner. In an automatically update setting unexpected changes may be pulled to my working project.
